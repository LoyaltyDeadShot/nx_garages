# ðŸš— NX Garages

An easy garage system with integrated `/givecar` `/delcar` `/impound` and `/deimpound` commands. As I said with commands, there is an integrated impound system too!

## ðŸ”Œ Configuration
In the `config.lua`:
- Customize your garage and impound blips
- Add new garage and impound locations
- Each garage has different spawn points (you can add more)
- Indicate groups that can do commands
- Edit the deimpound costs


## âœ¨ Future Releases
This is a pre-release for me. This resource will receive updates, first: the NUI. Then I'll listen to all community ideas for improving this resource and make it more configurable!
